# Linux Bing Wallpaper Shell Scripts

It sets Bing.com wallpaper of the Day as your Linux Desktop

supports XFCE4, GNOME3 and others, as well fallback to feh.

## Usage

Download these two scripts.

Put them somewhere (~/bin for example)

Change mkt varible in bing_wallpaper.sh to your market (valid values are: en-US, zh-CN, ja-JP, en-AU, en-UK, de-DE, en-NZ, en-CA)

Give the scripts execution permissions.

Make them autostart. (Google is your friend)

So next time you boot your computer for the first time a day, it'll run once.

Next boots it will run too, but do nothing.

        # Second param is true to exit immediately if you want to use a cron
        # (otherwise, script will sleep 24 hrs)
